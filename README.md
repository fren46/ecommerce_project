# eCommerce Project

Final project from the Advanced Programming course of the Polytechnic University of Turin in collaboration with Reply. 

## Usage

Run the following command from the folder where the `docker-compose.yml` is saved to automatically pull and start the containers: 

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The file is available in the assets of the project latest release (`v1.0`) with other ready-to-use resources. For example, `swagger.yaml` can be used to build and consult the API documentation on [swagger editor](editor.swagger.io). The only endpoint service (`catalogservice`) is exposed on port _8080_.
