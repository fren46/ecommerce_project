# eCommerce Project

Final project from the Advanced Programming course of the Polytechnic University of Turin in collaboration with Reply. 

## Usage

Performing the following command from the folder where the `docker-compose.yml` is saved to automatically pull and run the containers: 

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
The file is available in the assets of the project latest release (`v1.0`). Moreover, `swagger.yaml` can be used for building the API documentation on [swagger editor](editor.swagger.io). The only endpoint service (`catalogservice`) is exposed on port 8080.
